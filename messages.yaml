    Enter `$fd <character> <move>` to see that move's framedata.

  fields:
  - name: Characters
    value: Displays all characters with available data.

  - name: <character>
    value: Displays a character's moves and general attributes.

  - name: <character> <move>
    value: Displays the framedata of the specified move.

  - name: General
    value: Displays non-character-specific framedata.
