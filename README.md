# Description
This is a bot for discord which can display melee frame data. It reads information from a [spreadsheet][https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11i-YwUajgc6aWD8wSetYrb_bAM4RmL4FZi8XdBrMHo8], and displays information based on simple fuzzy-searched commands.

Any comments, criticism and feature suggestions are welcome!
*As of writing this I am still fairly unfamiliar with git and gitlab in general, so I'll apologize in advance for any missteps in this area.*

# Running this bot yourself
If you want to make your own instance of the bot, you'll have to add your own credentials.
You need:
- python application token
- google sheets api key(I don't think these are actually intended to be private but I'm being extra cautious for the time being)
And, if you want to use the included script for adding additional shield hitlag info,
- 2auth key for your google account
You'll also have to copy the spreadsheet of course.
