# Description
This is a bot for discord which displays frame data for the game Super Smash Bros. Melee. It reads information from a [spreadsheet][https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11i-YwUajgc6aWD8wSetYrb_bAM4RmL4FZi8XdBrMHo8], which is made accessible via easy to use fuzzy searched commands.

This project's main purpose was to be an exercise in Object Oriented programming for an application that doesn't have to maintain much state.
Any comments, criticism and feature suggestions are welcome!

# Running this bot yourself
If you want to run your own instance of the bot, you'll have to add your own credentials.
You need:
- discord application token
- Service account with access to a copy of the sheet used here.

If you have any trouble don't hesitate to contact me! I'm not expecting anyone to try to run the bot themselves so I haven't fully vetted the process from an outside user's perspective, but if you want to for whatever reason I'll be happy to help.
